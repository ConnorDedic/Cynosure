AI-Driven Malware Payload Generator & Go C2 Framework

Overview

This project focuses on developing an AI-driven malware payload generator using Python machine learning (ML) and Go for execution. The final goal is to integrate this payload generator into a Go-based Command & Control (C2) framework that incorporates ML for system fingerprinting and adaptive payload deployment.

Features

1. AI-Driven Payload Generation

Uses ML models to mutate and obfuscate Go-based malware payloads.

Generates payloads dynamically to evade AV/EDR detection.

Implements various obfuscation techniques such as syscall obfuscation, encryption, and packing.

2. Go-Based C2 Framework

Implements a secure, modular C2 server for payload deployment.

Uses WebSockets, TLS, and DNS tunneling for stealthy communication.

Supports post-exploitation modules (file exfiltration, keylogging, privilege escalation).

3. ML-Driven System Fingerprinting & Adaptive Payloads

Collects system information (OS, architecture, running processes, security tools).

Uses ML to select or modify payloads based on the system profile.

Dynamically generates payloads that adapt to the target environment.

Project Roadmap

Phase 1: AI-Driven Payload Generator (Python ML + Go Execution)



Phase 2: Go-Based C2 Framework



Phase 3: ML-Driven Adaptive Payload Deployment



Phase 4: Testing & Evasion Benchmarking


Ethical Considerations

Strictly for educational and research purposes.

Testing should only be conducted in isolated environments (sandboxed VMs).

Unauthorized use in real-world systems is illegal and strictly discouraged.
